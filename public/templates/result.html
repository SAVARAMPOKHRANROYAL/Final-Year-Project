            Maintain a healthy weight. Healthy eating and regular physical activity can help you maintain a healthy weight.

            <p>Advance directives are legal documents that outline your preferences and apply only if you are unable to make decisions. For health care planning, they communicate a person’s wishes ahead of time. Doctors and other providers follow these directives for your medical treatment. There are two main documents that are part of an advance directive:
            A living will lets doctors know how you want to be treated if you are dying or permanently unconscious and cannot make your own decisions about emergency treatment.
            A durable power of attorney for health care names someone as a “proxy” to make medical decisions for you when you are not able.</p>
